dotnet run

Frontend (Angular)

Plan is to add next automated scenario:
One hour before reservation user will get SMS notification reminding him that he has an appointment if he cannot make it he can edit the reservation by clicking the link which will redirect him to the editing reservation page.

Next scenario will happend after appointment:
User will get SMS with question how he liked service; if grade is less then 3 starts it wont be posted on google reviews, instead user will provide feedback what it can be better but if grade is 4 or 5 starts it will be posted on google reviews and 
pulled to site's Review section. 

This will increase productivity of employes because they dont have to manually do these procedures also it will make SEO better which will affect page rankings and make potential clients feel more confident in working with us.
